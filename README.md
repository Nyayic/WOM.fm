# WOM.fm
WOM.fm is an open platform for accessible audio information. This is a project of the Open Source for Equality. Open Source for Equality is a global initiative to promote the development and use of free and open software that bridges the digital gender gap.

WOM.fm can be used to make audio information accessible to marginalized populations using short urls (e.g. [wom.fm/123](https://wom.fm/123)) and QR codes. It should also enable local developers and content creators to build and deploy their own web apps. WOM.fm has been deployed to offer health education in a number of initiatives in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
