# WOM.fm with dial button

This is a modified version of wom.fm/123 which includes a phone button to dial the toll-free number of a local crisis hotline, in this case of WARIF (https://warifng.org). Phone numbers can easily be changed by editing 

```
<div id="phone" onclick="window.open('tel:+2348092100009');></div>
```
