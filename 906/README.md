# Aidryse

Aidryse is a web-based platform for accessing audio information on Gender Based Violence. In collaboration with South Saharan Social Development Organization (SSDO), we focused our work on a section of their many projects - Gender-based Violence. Understanding that GBV has become a prevalent social ill, we decided to create a platform that educates and shares stories of Gender-based violence in audio format.

Victims, witnesses or anyone seeking information on Gender-based Violence, can visit our website [Aidryse](https://aidryse.netlify.app/) and listen to educative content and stories in their preferred languages limited to Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo and English. AidRyse was built for the underrepresented minority in the society. We understand that not everyone is yet literate and so we have made the audio information available in the major Nigerian local languages. This, we believe, will facilitate information dissemination.

## Features

- Share your stories - Victims can share share their experiences as a form of encouragement to others
